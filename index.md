# SCCWRP R training

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is a language for statistical computing as well as a general purpose programming language. Increasingly, it has become one of the primary languages used in data science and for data analysis across many of the natural sciences. This series of workshops will provide attendees with the foundations for continued learning of R and for analysis of a range of data types. 

## Dates (2018)

All trainings will be in the medium conference room.  Prep material will also be circulated prior to each session.  Topics are tentative and may change.

R luncheons are a more informal approach to teaching you about R.  The intent is to encourage retention and continued learning from the previous lessons.  These will be short sessions (~ 1 hr) where we focus on one specific problem, e.g., creating a summary plot of data starting with a spreadsheet, formatting a dataset for an analysis, etc.  Lunch will follow each session.  

5) **7/11** [R luncheon 1](R_luncheon_1.html)
6) **8/8** [R luncheon 2](R_luncheon_2.html)
7) **9/5** [R luncheon 3](R_luncheon_3.html)
8) **10/3** [R luncheon 4](R_luncheon_4.html)

## Software requirements
